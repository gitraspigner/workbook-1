### 💭 My Thoughts
When I attended UW Seattle (and finished part of my *only-90%-completed bachelor's degree* which the rest was at UW Bothell) the majority of my coursework completed was in Java, given that the school primarily trained undergrads as backend developers and engineers. <br>
Therefore, the majority of this coursework I found to function mostly as a recap. But I forgot some of the things I had learned so it was a good recap.

#### 🔖 Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?*
