#### 💭 My Thoughts
When I attended UW Seattle (and finished part of my *only-90%-completed bachelor's degree* which the rest was at UW Bothell) the majority of my <br>
coursework completed was in Java, given that the school primarily trained undergrads as backend developers and engineers. <br>
Therefore, the majority of this coursework I found to function mostly as a recap. But I forgot some of the things I had learned so it was a good recap.
