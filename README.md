<u>#### My Thoughts</u>
When I attended UW Seattle (and finished part of my *only-90%-completed bachelor's degree* which the rest was at UW Bothell) the majority of my <br>
coursework completed was in Java, given that the school primarily trained undergrads as backend developers and engineers. <br>
Therefore, the majority of this coursework I found to function mostly as a recap. But I forgot some of the things I had learned so it was a good recap.

<u>#### Citation</u>
I wrote this, but this README.md was indeed partially generated by ChatGPT, therefore here is an APA Style Citation:  <br>

*We have to give credit where it's due, right?*
